/**
 * @brief Reads the equation from an MPS or QPS file.
 *
 * The input file can be a plain text file in MPS-/QPS-format or a compressed MPS/QPS
 * file (.mps.gz or .mps.bz2).
 *
 * Read this link http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/mps-format.htm for more
 * details on both free and fixed MPS format.
 * This function supports both standard MPS files (for linear programming) and
 * QPS files (for quadratic programming). QPS files are MPS files with additional
 * sections:
 * - QUADOBJ: Defines quadratic terms in the objective function
 * - QMATRIX: Full symmetric quadratic objective matrix (alternative to QUADOBJ)
 * - QCMATRIX: Symmetric quadratic terms for a named constraint row (QCQP)
 *
 * Note: Compressed MPS files .mps.gz, .mps.bz2 can only be read if the compression
 * libraries zlib or libbzip2 are installed, respectively.
 *
 * @param[in] mps_file_path Path to MPS/QPSfile.
 * @param[in] fixed_mps_format If MPS/QPS file should be parsed as fixed, false by default
 * @return mps_data_model_t A fully formed LP/QP problem which represents the given file

/**
 * @brief Reads a linear, mixed-integer, or quadratic optimization problem from
 *        a file in LP format.
 *
 * The LP format is a human-readable alternative to MPS format. This parser
 * supports the dialect in which the objective and constraints are written
 * as algebraic expressions over named variables (it does not implement the
 * alternative tableau-style LP dialect used by some open-source readers).
 *
 * Scope: LP, MIP, and QP problems are supported, plus semi-continuous
 * variables (via a Semi-Continuous section; finite upper bound required)
 * and quadratic constraints (QCQP; `<=` only).
 *
 * Quadratic terms appear inside `[ ... ]` blocks. The convention differs
 * between objective and constraints:
 *   - Objective bracket: MUST be followed by `/ 2` (the LP file states
 *     coefficients in the `0.5 x^T Q x` convention).
 *   - Constraint bracket: MUST NOT be followed by `/ 2`; Q coefficients are
 *     stored as upper triangular form.
 *
 * SOS constraints, PWL objectives, general constraints, and user cuts cause
 * a ValidationError when encountered.
 *
 * Compressed inputs (.lp.gz, .lp.bz2) are supported when zlib / libbzip2
 * are installed (same dispatching as read_mps).
 *
 * @param[in] lp_file_path Path to the LP file.
 * @return mps_data_model_t A fully formed LP/MIP/QP problem representing the
 *         given file.
